Submit a single README.txt file that states the MSS and receive window values before and after connecting for each case, and explain why these values did or didnâ€™t change, and why they might be different for the different IP addresses that were tested. If you get different results on your local machine, feel free to include them - particularly depending on your operating system you may see different results.
