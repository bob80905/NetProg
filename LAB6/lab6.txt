11: The ascii version would not open at all in preview, Safari, or Firefox. The binary version appears just fine. This is on the macOS Big Sur developer beta. This is due to the difference in handling newline in UNIX versus PC (carriage return before newline). For members of our team opening the ascii pdf on Windows, the pdf was viewable except the bottom of the logo image exhibited distortion. We believe this has the same cause and could have to do with images needing to be represented in binary due to compression.
